# High Availability and Scalability (ESG & ASG)

- there are two kinds of scalability
  - vertical scaling
  - horizontal scaling (elasticy)
- scalability is linked but different to high availability.

## Vertical scaling
- vertically scalabity means increase the size of the instance.
- for example, your application runs on a t2.micro.
- scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large.
- is more common is database systems (distributed systems)
- RDS, ElastiCache, are services that can scale vertically.
